# Music-Space
Music Space is a web app made using HTML5 and CSS3 . 
My main objective was to implement my knowledge of these two languages to maximum extent.
This website has a responsive design with a fluid layout i.e. it provides a wonderful experience irrespective of the device screen size.
This website has no Javascript, so not much functionality inherited.

Click on play button on any song to make Now-playing section visible.

Clicking on an artist profile opens another page about artist info (though its same for all).
